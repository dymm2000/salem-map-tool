= What-is-it and How-To =

This is small utility for combining and merging maps from the Salem game.

First, you will need the Ender's custom client

As well you will need .Net 3.5 (included in Windows 7)

Open the tool. There are sessions list on the left and image on the rigth.

Ender's custom client saves map tiles (100x100) in *!UserHome/Salem/maps*. It creates new session every time you teleport, login or enter to home, for example. 

Import session(s)

Now the sessions list is filled. You can see whole map of the session and switch zoom by right click on the image.

For merging two or more session with common tile select this tile on each session image (not zoomed) by left click

Then select those sessions in the list and choose "Merge"

You can remove session(s) from the list

It's important to save merge result, so you can load it in the future and use for further merges.

When exporting, the tool saves whole image as well as all tiles, so you can import merged session like original one.
